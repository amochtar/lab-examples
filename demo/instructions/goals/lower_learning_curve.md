# Lowering the Learning Curve

1. 🏗️ Make it possible to reuse pieces of the environment, scripts and content.
2. 🏗️ Make it possible to share these reusable pieces with others in the organization, or even with other organizations.
3. 🏗️ Support new users with visual editing, provide sensible defaults, hide advanced features.
4. ✅ Facilitate / take care of as much complexity as possible for the user, so they can focus on their actual content, instead of writing hacks.
5. ✅ Make it easier to use default docker images and other standard configurations.
