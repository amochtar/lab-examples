# More Flexibility in Content Flows

1. ✅ Make it easier to customize and extend the way users view and interact with lab content.
2. 🏗️ Make it possible to choose the content flow that fits the use-case of the lab, instead of only allowing linear paths and forced check completions.
3. ✅ Support more/richer content types for better learning experiences
