# Collaboration and versioning

It is extremely difficult to collaborate on content and reuse previous work without duplicating it.

“Porting all of their content from Killercoda and wants an easy way for team members to work from a custom set of templates. Things that they have to manually copy / paste are track scripts / check scripts, etc. Currently the CLI provides a hardcoded selection of templates that reflect the opinions of Instruqt but are not able to reflect the needs of a specific Organization.”

“Customer is adopting a new corporate strategy, to modularize a lot of their content into smaller tracks / less challenges.   Customer would like to be able to copy a group of tracks at once. A large number of tracks is challenging to organize, edit, distribute and manage.”

“Right now when they create a track they want available in different languages, they have to clone it and edit the text manually.”

“Customers want to create tracks (content and infrastructure) in a more efficient way so it's faster to add new tracks as well as maintain old ones (which some sort of library / shared code among tracks might be useful?).
It would be beneficial for the updates in such solution to possibly reflect the already created tracks to avoid updates in every single one of them manually.”

“When troubleshooting a track, we can’t work on the same track collaboratively, because you end up overwriting each others changes. 
We have to each create a clone and troubleshoot that separately, then have a horrible time figuring out the right way to merge once done.”
